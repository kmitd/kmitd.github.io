						<strong>Re-coding Black Mirror</strong> is a half-day workshop which aims at exploring how (semantic) web technologies could prevent or enable social and ethical concerns emanating from the wide use of digital advancements, as the dystopian future seen in Black Mirror's episodes. 
						<!-- Re-coding Black Mirror  is a full-day workshop which aims at exploring potential solutions that semantic web technologies could bring to social and ethical concerns emanating from the wide use of digital advancements. The potential risks of a dystopian future as depicted in scenarios such as the ones of the British sci-fi series  Black Mirror will be explored from a multi-disciplinary and dialectic approach. The workshop will enable participants to address emerging social phenomena from different perspectives building bridges in practice between two arguably distinct ‘worlds’ - the ones of computer and social sciences, introducing a rather innovative methodological approach, namely the one of animated case scenarios. Indeed,  Re-coding Black Mirror aims at promoting the dialogue between semantic web researchers and social scientists drawing upon case scenarios on specific technologies, with the objective to make emerge potential semantic solutions to societal and ethical challenges as discussed intensively within social science fields such as surveillance and mobile media studies. It will also be a forum for raising opportunities of networking with scholars from different fields to explore novel research problems that can be relevant to both communities. To that end, a mixed program committee and target audience is proposed, which combines both traditions. -->

<p>Re-coding Black Mirror is essentially about creating connections between researchers building semantic web technologies and interested in their potential future implication on society, and researchers studying such impact of technology interested in testing their views against current technological advances. We therefore expect two different types of works to be presented at the workshop, as described below. We provide brief summaries of examples of what those kinds of work could be. Possible submissions are of course not restricted to those examples, but works addressing those scenarios would be very much welcome too.</p>

<h3>Works showing how semantic web technologies can enable scenarios like the ones presented in Black Mirror:</h3>
<p>Here we are looking at how the ongoing research in the semantic web community could lead to technological advances similar to what is presented in one specific episode (or a set of episodes if it is a recurring trend). For example:</p>

<p><em>How could advances in semantically combining results in natural language processing and social media analysis lead to the ability to create a bot mimicking the personality of a dead person from their online contributions?</em> (S2E1)</p>

<p><em>How could semantic technologies be used to integrate information about another person from multiple online sources (digital footprinting), providing a mean for stalking or even blackmailing them? (S3E3)</em></p>

<h3>Works showing how semantic web technologies can be used to prevent or reduce the risks depicted in Black Mirror:</h3>

<p>Many of the episodes in Black Mirror rely on a practice and use of technology which is either unexpected in itself, or which consequences are unexpected. Here we are looking at how semantic web technologies could reduce those risks. For example:</p>

<p><em>How could relying on semantic relations between people and information about their network/context prevent the appearance of extreme cases in user ratings?</em> (S3E1)</p>

<p><em>How could semantic content and network analysis be used to reduce or counter the spread of hate on social media?</em> (S3E6)</p>

					        <p>Pinelopi is a Research Assistant at the Data Science Group of the Knowledge Media Institute, Open University (UK). Her research focuses on technology and society and more specifically on the surveillance occurring through the use of personal digital gadgets. Her Ph.D. research addressed issues of the subjective everyday surveillance using as a case study the smartphone devices. She specifically explored young users' articulation of the relationship with their smartphones and the negotiation with their surveillant aspects conducting focus groups with students at British universities and employing the use of visual vignettes. Pinelopi was Visiting Lecturer at the University of Westminster and Leeds Metropolitan University and Research Assistant for the fp7 project ICT ethics. She has been member of the organizing committee of international conferences, workshops and a summer school. She has presented her work in major conference mainly of the surveillance studies community and is co-editor of a special issue on surveillance and privacy at Westminster Papers in Communication and Culture.</p>

				        <p>Ilaria  is a Research Associate in the Data Science Group of the Knowledge Media Institute of the Open University (UK).  Her research is currently focusing on the interaction between robots and smart cities, and particularly on how robots can be integrated in a smart environment both as data producers and consumers, and how they can use the heterogeneous knowledge of the city to improve their tasks. As part of her Ph.D. research, Ilaria focused on exploiting Linked Data for Knowledge Discovery, through combining different machine learning and graph techniques to explain patterns automatically using information found in the Linked Data. Ilaria was part of the organisation of the LD4KD workshops ( LD4KD2014 ,  LD4KD2015 ), assisted the organisation of the  Semantic Web Summer School ( SSSW2015 ,  SSSW2016 ) and will be publicity chair of the next Knowledge Capture ( KCAP2017 )  conference.
